  bio = """Hello I'm Collin Kleest, I am currently Software Engineer at Vanguard.
  I began my programming journey when I was a senior in highschool. My interest was peaked and the rest is history. 
  I have over 1 years of experience in full time software engineering and 3 years of internships at multiple companies. 
  I specialize in backend development and DevOps (CI/CD) and have a fair bit of frontend development experience.
  I enjoy solving challening problems that put my brain to work. Outside of work I love to workout, ski, golf, watch sports
  and enjoy quality time with friends and family.
  
  As I was an engineer on a Platform as a Service team I have a lot of experience with cloud native tecnhologies
  and servless architetures. Most of my cloud experience has been with Amazon Web Services and a little bit of experience
  on the Google Cloud Platform.
  My favorite aspect of working in software is how fast the field moves and staying on my toes by learning new things.
  Feel free to contact me by reaching out on linkedin or via email, I also have my github linked below if you want to look
  at some of my personal projects!
